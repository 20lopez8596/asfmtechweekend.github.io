## FAQ's
### Will there be food?
Of course! We will provide dinner, breakfast, and lunch as well as additional snacks and drinks (and yes, including coffee).

### Will we sleep on the floor?
There will be some sofas around the library, but we do not guarantee that everyone will have one to sleep in. That being said, we do recommend bringing a sleeping bag and pillow. Just remember that the ASFM Library no longer has a carpeted floor.

### May we bring our own food?
We are excited to say that for this event only, the ASFM Staff has allowed us to eat inside the library! That being said, you MAY bring your own food and drinks, but please keep our ASFM Library clean.
