## Welcome to Hack_@ASFM 2018
Hack_@ASFM will be a 24-hour coding event where teams of two to six high school programmers will develop an application, game, or system. The project should ultimately strive to solve a global issue that will be revealed on the day of the event. As implied by the name of this event, it requires that students stay at ASFM\* overnight to code and complete their project (with parental permission of course).

\*Students will be staying at the ASFM Library — for more information please read below. 

The event will take place from **Friday, March 16 at 3:00 pm** to **Saturday, March 17 at 3:30 pm** at the ASFM Library.

## FAQ's
### Will there be food?
Of course! We will be providing breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as some additional snacks and drinks — don’t worry, that includes coffee!

### Will we sleep on the floor?
There will be some sofas around the library, but we do not guarantee that everyone will have one to sleep in. That being said, we do recommend bringing a sleeping bag and pillow. Just remember that the ASFM Library no longer has a carpeted floor.

### Should we bring our own computers?
Yes, and any other electronic device you would like to use. There will be at least one power outlet per person, but you might also want to bring your own power strip just in case.

### May we bring our own food?
We are excited to say that for this event only, the ASFM staff has allowed us to eat inside the library! That being said, you MAY bring your own food and drinks, but please keep our ASFM Library clean and remember that you will have to pick up after yourself.
